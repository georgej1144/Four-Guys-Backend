            About Us
          </h5>
          <p>
            Contrary to popular belief there are actually five guys in our team. 
            As the name was already taken we chose the closest name we could get. 
            We are five computer science students from the University of Colorado Boulder: Ben Courlang, 
            George Johnson, Gabriel Keith, Ryan Simcox, and Erik Wolf. The game was built for the Software Development Methods 
            and Tools class in the University of Colorado Boulder between January and April 2021. 
            Ben Courlang was one of our skilled Unity developers. George Johnson was our backend developer and integrated our 
            saving features and google account compatibility. Gabriel Keith was our front-end and webpage developer. 
            Ryan Simcox was our Unity script developer and one of our graphical asset designers. Erik Wolf was another graphical 
            asset designer along with being the project manager and one of our Unity developers.<br><br>
            We wanted our game not just to be another escape from reality, but a fun simple game that brings awareness to a current issue 
            in a light-hearted manner. We hope you enjoy the experience.
